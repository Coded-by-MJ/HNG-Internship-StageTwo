## Overview

I was accepted for the HNG internship on June 27th, 2024. This repository contains all the details of the Stage One Task I completed on the front-end track.







## Stage 2 Task  
In this stage, you'll step outside your individual coding zone and embrace collaboration! Here's the mission:

**Find a Designer:** Partner up with a designer. This is your chance to showcase your communication and teamwork skills.

**Design Implementation:** Collaborate with your designer to bring their Timbu Cloud shop page design to life. Translate the design into a functional webpage using React(.tsx/.jsx) / Nextjs(.tsx/.jsx). Make sure thereâ€™s a checkout page as well.
